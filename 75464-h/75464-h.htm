<span class="fs70">“WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Many persons who have devoted no time to
the study of physics wonder what the force is
that drives the street-car along—turning its
wheels, while at the same time furnishing incandescent
lamps (light) for the passengers.
They have been told, of course, that the “power”
used is “electricity”, generated by dynamos
“at the power-house”, and conveyed to the rapidly
moving car by the overhead wire.</p>

<p>“Electricity: yes, but what is electricity?”
This is a natural and perfectly legitimate question
for a layman to ask.</p>

<p>Scientists and philosophers are asking the
same question. But they understand quite well
that it is like asking: “What is matter?” Very
probably the average inquirer does not ask the
question, “What is electricity?” in the same
spirit. We can answer one question no better
than the other, if the ultimate nature of either
matter or electricity is what the inquirer has
in mind.</p>

<p>For matter, in the last analysis, is electricity.
Yet the same person who might ask: “What is
electricity?” would not think of asking: “What
is matter?” He thinks he knows what matter is—his
common sense tells him that <em>matter is
what it appears to be</em>. “Matter’s matter, and
there’s an end of it.”</p>

<p>And just so the physicist insists upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
common-sense right to reply: “Electricity is
electricity.” It is what it appears to him to be.
And it appears to be a form of <em>energy</em>, or a
<em>mode of motion</em>.</p>

<p>Thales, the reputed founder of Greek science
and philosophy, would call electricity “the soul
of the universe”, because it “endows all things
with motion”. This “soul”, interpenetrating all
matter—if not constituting it—is by nature always
moving—it is self-moving; motion is part
of its very essence. In the lodestone, said
Thales, “it moves iron.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>As has been said so many times before,
Thales was the first to call attention to the
fact that amber (fossilized resin), when rubbed
with wool or fur, possesses the curious property
of attracting small particles, such as straw,
pith, lint, dried leaves, etc.;—though there is
no reason to suppose that he was the discoverer
of this phenomenon. He called the amber
<em>elektron</em>; and today we call the indivisible
corpuscles, or natural unit charges of negative
electricity, <em>electrons</em>—the true <em>atoms</em> of electricity.</p>

<p>But hard rubber, or sealing-wax, is just as
“mysterious” as the lodestone (magnetite—natural
magnetic iron). Rub the sealing-wax
with fur, and it will exhibit all the peculiar
properties of the lodestone. Rub glass with
silk, and it, too, becomes a lodestone in effect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
The ancient Greek philosophers could not explain
these phenomena in precise terms.</p>

<p>Empedocles (born between 500 and 480 B. C.)
accounted for the attraction of iron to the magnet
on the hypothesis that “emanations” or
“effluences” from the magnet penetrate into
the “symmetrical pores” of the iron, drawing
the iron itself and holding it fast. The concept
“electricity” was unknown to the Greeks. But
it is possible that Empedocles had in mind some
such “effluence” or “emanation” as the “fluid”
electricity of Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)
and his successors.</p>

<p>The soul-force (“moving power”) of Thales—always
moving and causing movement—and the
“effluences” of Empedocles have become the
“field of force” of Faraday, Sir J. J. Thomson,
and Sir Oliver Lodge. The self-moving “soul”
of nature, manifest in the lodestone, or acting
on the lodestone, or on the particles said to be
“attracted” by the lodestone, is but a synonym
for the lines of force of the magnetic field of
modern physics. Thales and Empedocles spoke
in the language (terminology) of their day and
age. The “emanations” of Empedocles are the
“corpuscles” of Thomson—a body becoming
positively electrified by “losing some of its
corpuscles”, and hence capable of drawing
negatively charged particles to itself.</p>

<p>Electricity and magnetism are related but
not identical. A moving magnet can induce
an electric current in a wire, and an electric
current can produce magnetism in iron. The
construction of telegraph and telephone instruments
depends on the fact that an electric current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
can produce magnetism and that magnetism
can produce an electric current.</p>

<p>We know <em>effects</em> which we call “electricity”,
just as we know the phenomena associated
with living protoplasm without knowing what
“life” is. It may be that “life” and “electricity”,
as well as “electricity” and “magnetism”, are
all different aspects of the same thing.</p>

<p>Today we say, in the words of Dr. Charles
P. Steinmetz (“Relativity and Space”, Pages
18-19):—</p>

<p>“The space surrounding a magnet is a magnetic
field. If we electrify a piece of sealing-wax
by rubbing it, it surrounds itself by a
dielectric or electrostatic field, and bodies
susceptible to electrostatic forces—such as light
pieces of paper—are attracted. The earth is surrounded
by a gravitational field, the lines of
gravitational force issuing radially from the
earth. If a stone falls to the earth, it is due
to the stone’s being in the gravitational field
of the earth and being acted upon by it.”</p>

<p>Again:—“Suppose we have a permanent bar
magnet and bring a piece of iron near it. It is
attracted, or moved; that is, a force is exerted
on it. We bring a piece of copper near the magnet,
and nothing happens. We say that the
space surrounding the magnet is a <em>magnetic
field</em>. A <em>field</em>, or <em>field of force</em>, we define as
‘a condition in space exerting a force on a body
susceptible to this field’. Thus, a piece of
iron being magnetizable—that is, susceptible to
a magnetic field—will be acted upon; a piece of
copper, not being magnetizable, shows no action....
To produce a field of force requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
energy, and this energy is stored in the space
we call the field. Thus we can go further and
define the field as ‘<em>a condition of energy storage
in space exerting a force on a body susceptible
to this energy</em>’.”</p>

<p>Thales said that the “divine moving power”,
the soul of nature, under certain conditions
“moves iron”, through the mysterious properties
of the lodestone. Modern science, borrowing
from Aristotle the term <em>energia</em>, substitutes
for “soul of nature” the single word <em>energy</em>.
Aristotle declared that “not capacity, but energy
... is the first principle anterior to and
superior to anything else” (<cite>Metaphysics</cite> xii, 7:
cf. also <cite>Physics</cite> ii, 9, 6).</p>

<p>Modern science describes in more precise
phrases what <em>occurs</em> when a body susceptible to
the influence of the magnet is brought into
proximity to a lodestone (magnetite). It gives
us a picture of “lines of force” (energy) in a
defined “field”. But it tells us no more about
what energy <em>is</em> than Thales tells us what his
“moving power” is. Dr. Steinmetz tells us that
“energy is the only real existing entity, the
primary conception, which exists for us because
our senses respond to it” (<em>Op. cit.</em>, Page
23). For Thales the universal “moving power”
of nature operates <em>on</em> or <em>in</em> all matter; for the
physicist of today the moving power (energy)
is matter—man’s perception of matter being
the response of his senses to the vibrations of
energy. “All sense perceptions are exclusively
energy effects,” and “energy is the only real
existing entity.”</p>

<p>Thales may or may not have considered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
cosmos as “matter” <em>and</em> “soul” or “moving
power”. In any event the pre-Socratic Ionian
philosophers recognized no distinction between
matter and soul in our modern sense. The
moving power of nature (soul) was as much
a material substance as gross matter itself,
only more rarefied, more elusive. It was equivalent
to the “energy”—electricity—of modern
science.</p>

<p>Here we have, then, the answer to the question:
“What is electricity?” It is <em>energy</em>—“the
only real existing entity, the primary conception,
which exists for us because our senses respond
to it.” “All sense perceptions are exclusively
energy effects.” This is the answer
to the question: “What are the Hertzian waves,
used in ‘wireless’?” It is the answer also to the
question: “What is light?” as well as “What is
electricity?” By carrying the explanation of
the beam of light and the electromagnetic wave
(like that of the radio communication station or
that surrounding a power transmission line)
back to the <em>energy</em> field (or, less accurately,
the field of force), we have carried it back, as
Dr. Steinmetz well declared, as far as possible,
“to the fundamental or primary conceptions of
the human mind, the perceptions of the senses.”</p>

<p>All that we know of the world is derived from
the <em>perceptions of our senses</em>, which are for us
the only <em>real facts</em>, all things else being conclusions
from them; and “all sense perceptions
are exclusively <em>energy</em> effects.” Electricity is
an energy effect, perceived by our senses. No
other definition or explanation can or need
be given, since <em>energy is the primary conception</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
And this explains also what matter is,
since <em>energy</em> and <em>matter</em> are interchangeable—or
equivalent—terms. What we call electricity
is one of the <em>effects of energy</em> on our senses.
In itself, it <em>is</em> energy, the stuff that matter is
made of; at once the “moving power” and the
thing moved.</p>

<p>Everything has been said that can be said
now as to what electricity <em>is</em>: our concern in
the remainder of this volume will be to discover
what electricity <em>does</em> and how it acts.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The reader of this little book who may be
more or less familiar with larger volumes dealing
with electricity, energy, electrons, electromagnetic
waves or oscillations, magnetic and
dielectric fields (usually combined), light-waves,
etc., will notice that no mention has been made
of the classical ether hypothesis, the universal
<em>plenum</em> in which energy is said to be stored,
and in which transverse waves of light are
said to occur, ether atoms or vibrations moving
at right angles (perpendicularly) to the
light-beam.</p>

<p>Now, transverse waves can exist only in
rigid (solid) bodies. The universal ether of
space, referred to in the text-books, must—for
reasons which I need not discuss here—be a
solid body of a rigidity much greater than that
of steel, while at the same time possessing
a very great elasticity so that bodies (such
as the planets) moving through it meet with
no resistance, no friction. The electron theory
of Lorentz, Larmor, Thomson, Lodge and others
is based upon the assumption that such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
<em>plenum</em>, or medium, is a real substance. As a
matter of fact, it is not known that any such
medium (or ether) does exist, and it is now
recognized that while light is a <em>wave</em>, a periodic
phenomenon, like an alternating current, it is
not necessarily a wave <em>motion</em> of something or
in something, any more than it is necessary to
assume the alternating current or voltage wave
to be a motion of matter.</p>

<p>Electrical engineers make no assumption regarding
the existence of an ether filling all
space and interpenetrating all matter—have no
need for an ether as the hypothetical carrier
of the electric wave. And just so the physicist
of today has no real need for the classical assumption
that the light-wave is a wave motion
of or in something of great rigidity yet highly
elastic and frictionless, filling all space. Light
is now known to be a high-frequency electromagnetic
wave, and cannot logically be considered
as a wave motion of a hypothetical
ether. “The ether thus vanishes, following the
phlogistin and other antiquated conceptions.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
As Prof. A. S. Eddington remarks in his “Report
on the Relativity Theory of Gravitation”
(1920), “Light does not cause electromagnetic
oscillations; it <em>is</em> the oscillations.”</p>

<p>We know nothing whatever about the so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
ether of space; but we can formulate
very clearly “The Principles of Electricity”
without the aid of that hypothesis.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<span class="fs70">MAGNETIC PHENOMENA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was long ago observed that if glass is
rubbed by silk, or a piece of sealing-wax or
hard rubber by fur or wool, an effect occurs
similar to that noted by Thales when amber
is rubbed by similar materials—i. e., light bodies
such as bits of dry paper, pith, etc., will cling
to the surface of the substance. After coming
in contact with the attracting substance, the
bits of paper, straw, etc., are then repelled.</p>

<p>If a ball made of pith be suspended at the
end of a silk thread, and a glass rod which
has just been rubbed with silk be brought close
to the ball, the pith-ball immediately flies to
the rod, clinging to it for a time. Then it jumps
away, and instead of hanging vertically, seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
to be pushed away from the glass by a mysterious
force. A second ball, treated like the
first, and brought near the first, is violently repelled.
But if one ball is charged from the
glass and one from the wax, they attract instead
of repelling each other. Two pieces of
glass or two pieces of wax repel each other.</p>

<p>A similar attraction and repulsion was early
observed between the poles of the magnet. This
influence seems to be transmitted by some invisible
agency or medium across the intervening
space between the bodies, and in this respect
the force does not differ from that acting
between the moon and the earth, or the earth
and the sun. And just so, if a light piece of iron
is placed near a magnet, it moves to the magnet
and clings to it; but if the magnet is the
lighter of the two bodies, it moves toward the
piece of iron.</p>

<p>Although Thales had attempted to explain the
cause or nature of magnetic attraction as long
ago as the end of the seventh century B. C.,
or in the first quarter of the sixth century
(about 2,500 years ago), it was not until the
year 1582 A. D. that Dr. William Gilbert (1540-1603),
of Colchester, physician to Queen Elizabeth,
made the first experimental study of magnetic
phenomena. It is to Dr. Gilbert that we
owe the name <em>electricity</em> as applied to this
force, derived from his <cite>vis electrica</cite>.</p>

<p>By 1600, Dr. Gilbert had published his
epochal work “<cite>De Magnete</cite>”, which not only
contained the first rational treatment of magnetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and electrical phenomena, but was also
virtually the first scientific work published in
England. It is to this truly great treatise that
must be traced the beginnings of the science of
electricity.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Throwing aside, as useless, mere philosophical
speculation as to the nature of magnets,
Gilbert explained in his book how practical
experiments should be carried out. He insisted
that it is to nature herself that we must apply
for the answers to problems in “natural
history”. Gilbert’s particular objective was not,
however, discovery of the laws of magnetism
or electricity; what he most desired to learn
was <em>the composition of the earth</em>: he wished
to know through actual research just what is
its innermost constitution. His experiments led
him to the conclusion that <em>the earth is a magnet</em>.
It may, indeed, be considered a huge
spheroidal lodestone.</p>

<p>Gilbert told his readers to take a piece of
lodestone (natural magnetic iron) of convenient
size, turn it on a lathe to the form of a
ball, then place on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terella</i> (as he called
the spherical lodestone) a piece of iron wire. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
will then be observed that the ends of the wire
“move round its middle point.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Lodestones, fragments of magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>),
are said to have been first discovered at Magnesia,
in Asia Minor,—hence the word <em>magnetism</em>.
Some of the earliest references to the
lodestone relate to its property of lying in a
north-and-south direction when an elongate
stone is freely suspended, one particular end always
pointing northward, just as the great magnet
the earth, or the mariner’s compass-needle,
has two opposite magnetic poles. The location
of the poles of a disk-shaped stone is readily
found by turning it round in the presence of a
compass-needle.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Iron and steel are more strongly magnetic
than any other metals. While only one kind of
iron ore is naturally magnetic—forming magnets—the
property of magnetism may always
be given to any kind of iron or steel. One need
only strike an iron bar while it is lying in a
north-south position, or rub the iron with a
magnet, and it becomes a magnet. If it is
desired to make a <em>permanent</em> magnet, steel must
be employed. A compass-needle is therefore
made of magnetized steel. If balanced upon a
pivot, the positive pole of the needle will point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
(roughly) towards the earth’s north geographical
pole.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A compass-needle is also a “dipping needle”,
unless the suspended magnetized needle lies
about half way between the earth’s magnetic
poles. The north magnetic pole lies below the
earth’s surface—at an unknown depth—at the
extreme northeastern corner of the continent of
North America; and the corresponding south
magnetic pole on the edge of the Antarctic continent—King
George’s Land—about 2,300 miles
south of Australia. These magnetic poles do
not correspond even roughly with the geographic
poles, nor does the magnetic equator by
any means correspond with the geographic
equator.</p>

<p>Only a small section of the magnetic equator
runs north of the true (geographic) equator—e. g.,
from the coast of Brazil to the coast of
Kamerun (Africa).</p>

<p>According to Prof. T. J. J. See, “the whole
magnetic system has been pushed southward
200 miles by bodily displacement of both poles
towards the ocean hemisphere.” This eminent
physicist-astronomer also stated (in 1922) that
his researches led him to the discovery that the
two magnetic poles are at unequal depths in
the earth, the North Pole being much deeper
than the South Pole, “with the result that the
total magnetic forces in the southern hemisphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
are considerably stronger than in the
northern hemisphere.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It was long ago discovered that if one starts
northward from the magnetic equator, the
compass-needle soon begins to dip downward
(and northward). At the southern border of
the United States, the downward inclination
amounts to about 57 degrees. At the borders of
North Dakota and Maine the dip is about 76
degrees. By the time Hudson Bay is reached
the needle assumes a vertical position. This
means that it is here suspended immediately
over the north magnetic pole itself. At the magnetic
equator in Peru, a needle suspended by
a thread is exactly balanced. Dr. See states
that at the North and South Poles there is a
downward pull—by the magnetic force—of just
one millionth of the gravitational force, while
in Peru the total magnetic force is precisely
one ten millionths of gravitation.</p>

<p>It has been found that both the North and
the South Poles are anything but fixed in position.
They “wander about in their subterranean
region”. In the course of centuries, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
compass-needle swings from west of north, and
then to the east. Even the amount of the dip
slowly changes, in a periodic way, and at every
point on the earth. For example, in 1576, the
north end of the needle at London dipped at
an angle of 71 degrees 50 minutes. By 1720
the angle had increased to 74 degrees 42 minutes—almost
up and down. Since then, the dip at
London has continually decreased. At the present
time we are puzzled by the fact that the
inclination of the dip is 66½ degrees at London
and more than 70 degrees at Washington.</p>

<p>It has long been known that variations in
magnetic declination of the delicately mounted
needles, in observatories, are directly correlated
with solar disturbances. The late Dr. A.
Wolfer (sometime director of the Zurich Observatory)
was the first to show us how closely
the curve of the sun-spot activity rises and
falls with the fluctuations of magnetic declinations.</p>

<p>Before attempting to explain the peculiarities
of magnetic action in terms of the modern electromagnetic
theory, it will be well to recall
certain stages of progress in the development of
this theory. This plan will permit elucidation
of the theory itself by “easy steps”.</p>

<span class="fs70">PIONEERS IN ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Danish physicist, Hans Christian Örsted,
professor of natural philosophy at the University
of Copenhagen, showed us, more than a
century ago, that a magnetic needle can be
deflected by an electric current. He had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
led by theoretical considerations to assume that
there must be a correlation between electric
and magnetic forces. While yet a young man,
Örsted endeavored by persevering experimentation
to prove the correctness of his theory.
While he did not expect a parallel action of the
two forces, he was firmly convinced that magnetism
and electricity were inseparable twins.</p>

<p>He noted that both heat and light radiated
from a conductor when heated to incandescence.
He also assumed that magnetic forces are radiated
from a conductor traversed by electricity.</p>

<p>In 1820, while lecturing before his class, he
became convinced that the apparatus he was
then using could be made to demonstrate the
correctness of his views. He asked his pupils to
accompany him to his laboratory, where, as he
predicted, a slight deflection of the magnetic
needle, turned at right angles to the electric
current, was shown when placed close to the
copper wire. Some months afterwards, with
a stronger current (made up of twenty cells),
he obtained much more intense effects. Investigating
these in detail, he found that they met
all the requirements of his theory. So, on July
21, 1820, he sent out to the scientific world his
now famous circular, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Experimenta circa effectum
conflictus electrici in acum magneticum</i>”
(Experiments on the effect of the electrical
conflict in the magnetic needle).</p>

<p>Örsted showed, furthermore, how changes in
the position of the magnetic needle occurred
with variation of the position of the conductor
(copper wire) in regard to it. He demonstrated
also that the magnetic effect was not weakened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
by insulators—that it would penetrate various
materials, whether these were conductors of
electric currents or not. He showed that the
magnetic field created by the electric current
does not have any influence on a needle of non-magnetic
material—i. e., brass, glass, etc. It is,
in fact, chiefly in the fact that it cannot be insulated
that magnetism differs from electricity.
It will freely pass through air, stone, mica,
glass, clay, brick, or any insulating material.</p>

<p>It is well worthy of especial mention that
Örsted employed the term “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conflictus</i>” to
designate the electric current, many decades
before the origin of the electron theory of matter.
For, on modern theories of electricity, it
is the movement to and fro of electric particles
(electrons) through the conductor, and their
impact (“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conflictus</i>”) that produces what we
call electrical phenomena.</p>

<p>Örsted’s fundamental discovery of the mutual
effects between electricity and magnetism
led to further discoveries which made possible
the construction of telegraph and telephone instruments,
since these depend on the fact that
<em>an electric current can produce magnetism,
and that magnetism can produce an electric
current</em>.</p>

<p>If we wind around an iron bar a number
of turns of insulated wire, and an electric current
is allowed to pass through the coil, the
bar becomes a strong electromagnet. But it remains
a magnet only as long as the current is
passing. Now, the magnetic effects obtained
with the electromagnet are identical with those
obtained from a permanent magnet—such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the familiar horseshoe magnet, commonly seen
on the flywheel of the Ford automobile, or in
the ordinary telephone generator for calling up
“Central”. In the case of a telegraph instrument,
it is important that the iron is a temporary
magnet. On the other hand, a permanent
magnet is an essential part of every Bell telephone
receiver. This permanency is secured by
employing a bar of steel instead of a piece of
iron—a temporary magnet.</p>

<p>The power produced from a dynamo—or electric
generator—depends upon the fact that
when a magnet is put into a coil of wire, only
a momentary current of electricity passes
through the wire, in one direction. If the magnet
is withdrawn, a current starts in the opposite
direction. Copper wire coiled about an
iron core forms the “armature” of the dynamo.
The rotating coils are said to “cut the magnetic
field.” On this principle of electricity,
intense electric currents are produced, furnishing
the “power” for the electric motors in electric
cars, elevators, musical instruments, etc.,
and for electric lights—incandescent and arc.</p>

<p>Dynamos may contain either permanent magnets
or electromagnets. They produce the magnetic
field in which the “armature” or conductor—the
coils of wire wound around the
iron core—rotates. A machine with permanent
magnets is usually termed a <em>magneto</em>, and is
never made in large sizes. The current for the
electromagnets may be derived wholly from an
outside source, or part of the current which
it generates may be used for that purpose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
The current generated in the armature winding
is alternating, but may be rectified to a direct
current by a <em>commuter</em> if desired; otherwise
it is conveyed to the line circuit by <em>collector</em> or
slip rings and brushes.</p>

<p>We owe much of our knowledge of magnetism
and electricity to Michael Faraday (1791-1867),
who brilliantly covered the whole field of these
sciences. Faraday was distinguished alike as a
chemist and as an experimenter in electricity
and magnetism.</p>

<p>Örsted had shown that magnetism could be
produced by a current of electricity, but it remained
for Faraday to produce current electricity
by a magnetic “field of force”, thus laying
the foundation for those modern industries
which derived motive force for their machinery
from the gigantic dynamos of our “power
houses”.</p>

<p>But I must here introduce a few facts concerning
the contributions to electric theory and
practice of the great French mathematician and
physicist, André Marie Ampère (1775-1836). His
discoveries in electrodynamics aided greatly
in laying a broad foundation for this science.
Very notable was the influence exercised by
Ampère on the development of electrodynamics.
And it was he who first clearly established the
fact that magnetic action is a peculiar form
of electromotive action, and that, in phenomena
of this class, “action and reaction are equal
and opposite.”</p>

<p>From these considerations it was natural for
him to suppose that magnetism might be made
to produce electricity, as it had already been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
shown that electricity might be made to imitate
all the effects of magnetism. Numerous
attempts were made to effect this predicted
result, but for some years all such efforts
proved to be fruitless.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French physicist and astronomer,
François Arago (1785-1853), was also conducting
experiments with the object of producing
electricity by magnetism. One of his experiments
actually involved the effect sought,
but it was not clearly recognized. Arago observed
that the rapid revolution of a conducting
plate in the neighborhood of a magnet gave
rise to a force acting on the magnet. But it
was not recognized by either Arago or other
physicists of the day that the forces involved
were electric currents—produced by the rapidly
revolving conducting plate.</p>

<p>Faraday, in 1831, after several years of preoccupation
with other problems, returned to his
task of discovering electrodynamical induction,
begun in 1825. After a number of fruitless efforts,
he was finally rewarded with success,
but not in the form which had been anticipated.
It was observed that at the precise time of
making or breaking the contact which closed
the galvanic circuit, a momentary effect was induced
in a neighboring wire, which, however,
disappeared instantly.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Faraday then discovered that a similar effect
could be induced merely by moving the wire
nearer to or farther away from the closed circuit—instead
of suddenly making or breaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the contact of the “inducing circuit”. Later he
found that the effects were increased by the
proximity of soft iron, and that when the soft
iron was affected by an ordinary magnet instead
of the voltaic wire, the same effect still
recurred. The momentary electric current was
produced either by moving the magnet or by
moving the wire with reference to the magnet.
Finally, it was found that the earth itself might
be substituted for a magnet, not only in this experiment
but also in others. Mere motion of a
wire, under proper conditions, produced the effect.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the true explanation of
Arago’s experiment: by the rapid revolution of
the plate the momentary effect became continuous.
Without using the magnet, a revolving
plate became an electrical machine. A revolving
globe was found to exhibit electromagnetic action,
the circuit being complete in the globe
itself without the addition of any wire. It was
later found by Faraday that mere motion of the
wire of a galvanometer produced an electrodynamic
effect upon the needle.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ampère, “by a combination of
mathematical skill and experimental ingenuity,
first proved that two electric currents act on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
one another, and then analyzed this action into
the resultant of a system of push-and-pull forces
between the elementary parts of these currents.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Örsted having shown that electric currents
produced certain effects on magnets without
being in actual contact, and Ampère having
demonstrated that magnets can in their turn
be supplemented by electric currents,—a magnetic
needle being deflected not only by a current
passing through a wire, but also by another
magnet brought into its neighborhood,
and two electric currents acting on one another
at a distance—the question now arose as
to whether or not electrical attraction and repulsion
could be reduced to an action at a distance
proportional to the inverse square of the
distance.</p>

<p>As early as 1773, Henry Cavendish (1731-1810)—one
of the foremost chemists and experimentalists
of his day—answered this question
affirmatively by experiment.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Coulomb
(1736-1806)—inventor of the torsion balance—showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
that ponderable matter charged with
electricity followed the same formula for attraction
and repulsion as gravitating bodies did.
Poisson (1781-1840) worked out the difficult
mathematics of fluids actuated by repelling
forces depending on the inverse square of the
distance. Laplace (1749-1827) had very early
become convinced that the actions of ponderable
substances in which electric currents were
flowing could be reduced to an action at a distance
proportional to the inverse square of the
elements of the electric current.</p>

<p>Faraday regarded the electric field as full
of lines of electric force, in a state of tension,
and naturally repelling each other. To him,
as to a number of his contemporaries, the idea
of “action at a distance” was repugnant; though
such a possibility seemed to be indicated by
the action of gravitation—the relation of the
forces between two charged bodies to the distance
between them being very similar to that
of the gravitational forces between two bodies
to the distance between them. But Faraday,
like the great Descartes long before him, rejected
the theory of action at a distance in
favor of “action through a medium.”</p>

<p>Ampère had sought for some sort of mechanism
for the transmission of electromagnetic
currents. His own discoveries and those
of Örsted led him to formulate the hypothesis
that the field in the vicinity of a magnetic
body is produced by a number of exceedingly
small circular currents which flow undamped
in or around the molecules and that magnetization
consists merely of the bringing of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
molecular currents into a parallel direction.
But it was difficult for some physicists, even
in Ampère’s day, to accept the hypothesis of
undiminished currents <em>possessing no resistance</em>.</p>

<p>If we transform the idea of the “molecular
currents” of Ampère into the language of today,
substituting for these molecular currents
electrons revolving in atoms, it can be shown
that the great French scientist was substantially
correct in his assumptions. In 1915 Dr. Albert
Einstein and W. J. de Haas astonished
the world of physicists by showing experimentally—by
means of a most ingenious apparatus—that
the “molecular currents” or revolving
electrons really exist.</p>

<p>In 1919, Professor Kramerlingh-Onnes, at the
University of Leyden, was able to produce what
he called <em>imitations of ampere currents</em>—i. e.,
“undiminished currents producing no resistance.”
It was demonstrated that the resistance
of pure gold and pure platinum differ very
little if at all from nil at low temperatures.
But wires of these metals, of absolute purity,
are difficult to obtain, so mercury was selected
for the experiments. The resistance of the
metal at the lowest attainable temperature of
liquefied helium,-271.5° C., (at a pressure of
3 mm. of the mercury column), proved to be
immeasurably small. The resistance down to
a position shortly below 4.2° K. (Kelvin’s absolute
scale) suddenly dropped from a measurable
amount to a value practically nil. It was
found that the induced current remained in a
state of circulation, and that the decrease in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the strength of the current amounted to less
than 1 per cent per hour, from which it followed
that the “time of relaxation” must
amount to more than four days!<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>At the absolute zero of temperature, it is
supposed that the orbits of electrons in atoms
are perfect circles, whatever their paths may
be at measurable temperatures. This motion
of the electrons remains when all heat has
disappeared, since it is not this motion of the
revolution of the electrons in their orbits that
is associated with the energy of heat. Heat is
<em>a mode of motion of the atoms themselves</em>,
not of their contained electrons; though increase
of heat doubtless results in an increase
in the average orbital velocity of the electrons.</p>

<p>Since Ampère’s day we have learned at all
events, that an electric current means the flow
of electrons, either from atom to atom, or
passing between the atoms, along conductors.
In 1920, Lord Kelvin came to the conclusion
that at the absolute zero resistance of metals
must be infinitely great, the degrees of dissociation
of the electron being, he supposed, nil
at the zero hour. If any free electrons remained,
he believed they would lose their power
of motion, condensing like a vapor upon the
metal atoms and freezing fast to them (to
borrow a phrase from Kamerlingh-Onnes). The
experiments of the celebrated Holland physicist
show that the resistance of metals decreases
with lowering of temperature, and would probably
become nil at the absolute zero with employment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
of a perfectly pure platinum wire. If
this is true, then would a current of electricity,
once set up in a conductor, continue forever?</p>

<span class="fs70">THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The science of electricity is based upon observation
of those phenomena of attraction
and repulsion which are comprehended under
the term <em>electrostatics</em>. Statical electricity, so
named from a Greek word (statikos), which
means “causing to stand (or stay),”—also
called <em>frictional electricity</em>—is the electricity
of stationary charges caused by rubbing together
unlike bodies, such as glass and silk
(noted in Chapter II). In such cases equal
and opposite charges of electricity are always
produced. The term <em>statical electricity</em> applies
properly, however, to the electricity of all stationary
charges, however produced.</p>

<p>The electricity upon the surface of glass is
called positive electricity; that upon rubber,
negative electricity. When silk is rubbed upon
glass it receives a negative charge from the
glass and confers a positive charge upon the
silk. Wool or fur rubbed on wax or rubber
receives a positive charge in exchange for a
negative charge; “equal and opposite charges
of electricity are always produced.” A piece
of glass and a piece of silk attract one another;
two pieces of silk or two pieces of glass or
wax repel one another, because a body which is
positively charged is attracted by one negatively
charged and repelled by one negatively
charged, and vice versa. A piece of glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
rubbed by a piece of silk, under suitable conditions,
attracts any other body with which it
has not been in contact. The piece of silk will
do likewise. In all these cases, the attraction
or repulsion becomes weaker with increase of
distance between the attracting and repelling
bodies.</p>

<p>A third body which has been in contact with
a piece of glass or a piece of silk acquires to
some extent the properties of the glass or silk
with which the third body has been in contact.
And, conversely, the glass or silk with which
the third body has been in contact attracts or
repels with less force than before. If a hand
is drawn over the surface of an object after
it has been charged with electricity, the electricity
disappears. It has been conducted
through the hand and the body to the earth.
This phenomenon shows that the human body
is a <em>conductor</em> of electricity. But most metals
are much better conductors. Moist air and
damp wood are rather poor conductors, while
dry air, dry wood, porcelain, glass, hard rubber
and sealing-wax are <em>non-conductors</em>, or <em>insulators</em>.</p>

<p>The term <em>dielectric</em> is used in preference to
<em>insulation</em> when reference is made to the property
of transmitting <em>induction</em>—a process quite
distinct from ordinary transmission of an electric
current. In <em>electrostatic induction</em>, a body
electrostatically charged induces in a neighboring
conductor a like charge in the parts farthest
from the charged body, and an unlike charge in
the nearer parts; the repelled like charge being
removed by connecting any part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
conductor momentarily with the earth, while
the bound unlike charge spreads over the whole
surface of the conductor and remains there
even when the inducing body is moved away,
or its charge neutralized, if the conductor is
properly insulated.</p>

<p><em>Dielectric strength</em> refers to the ability of an
insulating material to resist rupture by high
voltage, measured by the voltage necessary to
effect a disruptive discharge through it. <em>Insulation
resistance</em>, on the other hand, refers
to the <em>ohmic</em> resistance <em>offered</em> by an insulating
material to an impressed voltage, tending to
induce a breakage of current through it. The
term <em>dielectric</em> is used as a synonym for <em>insulator</em>,
in the sense that a charge on one part
of a non-conductor is not communicated to any
other part. A charge given to a conductor
spreads to all parts of the body. A dielectric
possesses the property of transmitting electric
force by <em>in</em>duction but not by <em>con</em>duction. A
charge on one part of a non-conductor or dielectric
is not communicated to any other part.</p>

<p>Jeans suggests that since the presence of
magnetic energy is always associated with
charges in motion, whereas electrostatic energy
is present when all the charges are at rest
relatively to each other, it may be proper to
identify electrostatic energy with potential
energy, and magnetic energy with kinetic energy<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>—i.
e., energy due to motion of particles,
rather than to energy of position, as of a coiled

<p>Statical energy is distinguished from “current
electricity” by the fact that it accumulates
on various bodies—is stored up—and as soon
as proper connections are made, it discharges
instantly. Statical electricity is used by physicians
in electrical treatment of diseases and
in X-ray work. Machines have been constructed
that will produce very strong charges of statical
electricity.</p>

<p>If a sufficiently large charge of electricity
accumulates upon an insulated conductor in
an electrical machine, it finally discharges itself,
passing through the air to the nearest
body. A flash of lightning is the result of an
overcharge of statical electricity accumulated
upon cloud particles, and may pass from cloud
to cloud or descend to the earth.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Careful
drivers of gasoline-tank wagons allow an iron
or steel chain to drag on the roadway from a
metallic connection, which conducts any surplus
“static” to the ground. Failure to provide
for such an emergency sometimes results in a
terrific explosion with consequent loss of life.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the nineteenth century,
the Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta
(1745-1827),—and other physicists—discovered
what has been called, after Volta, <em>voltaic electricity</em>,
a current generated by chemical action
between metals and different liquids as arranged
in a voltaic battery. The term “volt”—the
electromotive force which performs work
at the rate of one joule per second (one watt)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
in producing a current of one ampere—was
similarly derived.</p>

<p>It was learned that if two different metals,
such as copper and zinc amalgam, are placed
in a weak acid solution (such as one part H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
to four parts H<sub>2</sub>O), and connected by a wire
fastened securely to the metals, a current of
electricity (about two volts) will pass through
the wire. Carbon (a non-metal) and a metal
upon which the solution acts chemically may
be used instead of two metals. There must be
chemical action between the liquid and one
metal, or there will be no current. Such a
combination constitutes a <em>cell</em>, and two or more
cells make a <em>battery</em>. The current starts with
the zinc, is conducted by the solution to the
copper, and thence by wire back to the zinc,
completing a <em>circuit</em>. The zinc constitutes the
negative pole (or electrode), the copper or carbon
the positive pole (or electrode).</p>

<p>A cell frequently employed, where a weak
(about 1.1 volts) but constant electromotive
force (“E. M. F.”) is required, is one devised
by the English physicist, John D. Daniell (1790-1845).
In this cell a copper sulphate solution
containing a copper electrode is placed in contact
(by means of a porous wall or partition—usually
an unglazed porcelain cup) with a zinc
sulphate solution containing a zinc electrode.
The zinc electrode is negative to the copper.
At each electrode there exists a potential difference
between solution and electrode.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
two electrodes being connected externally by
a wire, a current of electricity will flow through
the wire from the copper to the zinc, and zinc
will dissolve at the anode (positive pole) and
copper deposited on the cathode (negative
pole). The current in this case, as in the preceding,
is said to be produced by <em>voltaic action</em>
and the cell is a primary battery. Voltaic action
and <em>electrolysis</em>—the process of chemical
decomposition (or dissociation of compounds
or molecules)—by the action of an electric current
produced externally (as by a dynamo) and
forced through the cell, are essentially identical
phenomena, and obey the same laws.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The familiar <em>dry cell</em> contains no liquid which
might be spilled, and is very useful for certain
purposes, as in automobiles, and in operating
door-bells. It is merely a voltaic cell whose
chemical contents are made practically solid
(or paste-like) by the use of some absorbent,
as gelatine, sawdust, etc. In cells of the
Leclanché type, a mixture of plaster of Paris,
flour, and sal ammoniac takes the place of the
solution which acts chemically upon one of
the contained metals. When used up, a dry
cell must be replaced by an entirely new cell.
Two or more dry cells constitute a <em>dry battery</em>.</p>

<p>We have seen that there are two types
of charged bodies, of which charged glass and
charged silk are familiar examples. It was
Dufay (1699-1739) who discovered that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
were two kinds of electricity, one of which
he called <em>vitreous</em> (from glass) and the other
<em>resinous</em> (from resin—amber). The terms
“positive” and “negative” in relation to electricity
were first applied by Benjamin Franklin,
in 1756. To the electricity of the glass rod
Franklin gave the name “positive” and to that
of the sealing-wax (or hard rubber, amber,
etc.) the name “negative.” These names are
now universally in use—though French physicists
still speak of vitreous and resinous electricity.</p>

<p>I have spoken also of a positive pole (or
electrode) and a negative pole (or electrode).
The electrodes constituting the two poles of a
current are also called the anode and the
cathode, the former being the positive electrode
and the latter the negative electrode.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>When it was learned that electrical charges
could be distinguished by two opposing terms—positive
and negative—it was natural to suppose
that there were two distinct kinds of
electricity, or “fluids.” This was the view
taken by the French chemist Dufay. But the
German electrician Æpinus (1724-1802), in his
great pioneer work, “<cite>Tentamen Theoriae Electriciatis
et Magnetismi</cite>” (An Attempt at a
Theory of Electricity and Magnetism—1759),
considered the mathematical consequences of
the hypothesis of a single fluid, attracting all
matter but repelling itself. It soon became
apparent, however, that he must assume either
the existence of two electrical fluids or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
mutual repulsion of material particles. He
chose the latter theory. He explained the
phenomena of the opposite poles as results of
the excess and deficiency of a “magnetic fluid,”
which was dislodged and accumulated in the
ends of the body, by the repulsion of its own
particles, and by the attraction of iron and
steel, as in the case of induced electricity.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Æpinus, who was unquestionably one of the
greatest physicists of the eighteenth century,
devised a method of examining the nature of
the electricity at any part of the surface of a
body, by which means he was enabled to ascertain
its distribution. He found that the distribution
was in agreement with the attractions
and repulsions which objects exert when they
are in the neighborhood—“electrical atmosphere”—of
electrified bodies. Today we say
that such bodies are electrified by induction.</p>

<p>The Æpinian theory of electricity and of
magnetism was modified and presented in a
new form (in 1788) by Coulomb, with two fluids
instead of one. His first task, before reducing
the theory to calculation, was to determine
the law of the forces involved—not being satisfied,
for example, with Newton’s assumption
that the attractive force of magnetism is inversely
to the <em>cube</em> of the distance. Mayer in
1760, and Lambert a few years later, had
found the law to be that of the inverse square.
Coulomb desired experimental confirmation of
this law before accepting it as established.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
This he secured by means of his torsion-balance
(about 1784).<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It was in pursuance of this investigation that
Coulomb brought to light for the first time the
fact that the directive magnetic forces which
the earth exerts upon a needle is a constant
quantity, parallel to the magnetic meridian,
and passing through the same point of the
needle whatever be its position.</p>

<p>Barlow, who had adopted the two-fluid hypothesis,
showed that the magnetic “fluids”
were collected at the surface of spheres (of
iron), the surface being the only part in which
there could be detected any magnetism. He
demonstrated that a shell of iron produces the
same effect as a solid ball of the same diameter.
Poisson’s later analysis (1824) showed
that this was a consequent to be expected.
Merz has well said that what Laplace did for
Newton was done by Poisson (1781-1840) “for
Coulomb’s elementary law of electric and magnetic
action, and on a still larger scale by
Gauss, who worked out the mathematical theory
and applied it to the case of the magnetic
distribution on the earth’s surface. In England,
already before Coulomb’s researches were
published, Cavendish had, likewise by a combination
of experiment and calculation, established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
the elementary formulae and properties
of electrical phenomena.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin, the first American to
gain international renown as a scientist, adopted
and developed a “one-fluid theory of electricity.”
On this supposition the parts of the
fluid repel each other, and the excess in one
surface of the glass—for example—repels the
fluid from the other surface. The fluid itself
was regarded by Franklin as positive, the part
of the other (negative electricity) being taken
by ordinary matter, the particles of which were
supposed to repel each other and attract the
positive fluid, just as the particles of the negative
fluid did on the two-fluid theory.</p>

<p>On both the two-fluid and the one-fluid
theories, as we have seen, the particles of the
positive fluid repelled each other by forces
varying inversely as the square of the distance
between them—as shown by both Æpinus and
Coulomb. This is true also of the particles of
the negative fluid. The particles of the positive
fluid attracted those of the negative fluid.
In Franklin’s one-fluid theory it was the ordinary
particles of matter which attracted the
positive fluid and repelled one another. Both
theories from their very nature imply, as Sir
J. J. Thomson long ago (1906) pointed out, the
idea of action at a distance.</p>

<p>In his very interesting book, “Matter and
Energy” (1912), Professor Soddy says: “All
electrical phenomena can be explained as well
on the one-fluid as on the two-fluid idea, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
our ignorance at the present time as to whether
there are two kinds of electricity or one is
fundamental. Until the question is settled,
the hopes that have been entertained that,
through the study of electricity, we shall be
able to arrive at a philosophical explanation
of matter, are likely to prove unfounded.”</p>

<p>Our modern view of electrification bears a
close resemblance to the one-fluid theory of
Franklin, whether we suppose there is one
kind of electricity, or two kinds. At all events,
if there be such a separate force, or such units
of energy, as “positive” electricity, it has never
been isolated, as have been the negative atoms
or electrons. Negative electrification is but a
collection of these negative corpuscles or unit
charges. The particles of the “electric fluid”
of Franklin correspond to these electrons.</p>

<p>“Instead of taking, as Franklin did, the electric
fluid to be positive electricity, we take it
to be negative,” says J. J. Thomson, in his
“Corpuscular Theory of Matter” (1906). And
“the transference of electrification from one
place to another is effected by this motion of
corpuscles from the place where there is a gain
of positive electrification to the place where
there is a gain of negative. A positively electrified
body is one that has lost some of its
corpuscles.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<span class="fs70">MODERN MAGNETIC THEORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We have already shown how the magnetism
of a magnet is converted into electricity, by
means of rotating coils cutting the lines of
magnetic force in the “field.” The energy used
to drive the machinery may, of course, be derived
either from water-power or by steam.
Gravity gives energy to falling water; chemical
energy produced by the oxidation of coal
becomes heat energy, which in turn causes the
expansion of steam, which produces energy of
motion in a piston; and this motion, transmitted
to the parts of an engine to a dynamo,
produces electrical energy. When the electric
current from the dynamo has been conducted
to any desired point by cables, another motor,
acting in the opposite sense, causes the electricity
to change back again into the original
mechanical energy, less the loss due to imperfections
in the operation. Here we have,
then a clear picture of what is meant by the
phrase, <em>transformation of energy</em>.</p>

<p>But another question naturally arises at this
point. We know that with a finite quantity
of magnetism we can produce an unlimited
quantity of electricity. Yet we add no new
material, no source of supply, to the dynamo.
Let the rotating coils continue to cut the lines
of magnetic force in the magnetic field, and
the magnetism of the magnet will be transformed
into current electricity—furnishing a
literally exhaustless supply from the great
storehouse of nature. For us the energy of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
universe is infinite in quantity. The reservoir
of energy is exhaustless, and the dynamo is
man’s open sesame.</p>

<p>But just here the very interesting question
arises: Is the inexhaustible supply of electric
current with the expenditure of a limited quantity
of magnetism fully explained by saying
that it is due to the rotational movement of
the coil? Can the mere rotation of a metal
in a magnetic field actually <em>create</em> an endless
supply of available energy? Not likely! As
Dr. Gustave Le Bon well says: “Such a
metamorphosis would be as marvelous as transformation
of lead into gold by simply shaking
it in a bottle. Another interpretation must be
sought for the phenomenon.”</p>

<p>Now, a current of electricity is known to be
a stream of electrons (negative charges) flowing
along or in a conductor; and an electron is
an atom of—<em>energy</em>. But where was this
energy stored? “In the all-pervasive ether,”
say many physicists. “There is no ether,” say
others. The electromagnetic field represents
energy storage <em>in space</em>—not in a universal,
incomprehensible, paradoxical something called
“ether.”</p>

<p>A field of <em>energy</em> is intelligible. It takes the
place of the conception of action at a distance
and of the ether. No “ether” need be postulated
as the carrier of the field energy in space.
It is its own carrier. “Energy is the only real
existing entity, the primary conception, which
exists for us because our senses respond to it”
(Steinmetz).</p>

<p>“Lines of force,” says Dr. N. R. Campbell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the famous English physicist, “are just lines
of force, independent for their existence of all
surrounding bodies, and there is no more to be
said about them.... Our Electrical theory,
so far from providing additional support for
the conception of the ether filling all space,
does not require such a conception at all.”</p>

<p>Dr. Le Bon finds the exhaustless source of
electricity in the interior of atoms. The atoms
in one pound of earth contain enough energy to
run all the factories, mills, railroads, etc., and
light all the cities and villages of the United
States, for a month, Steinmetz tells us. “It
would,” he states further (“Relativity and
Space,” Page 45), “supply the fuel for the
biggest transatlantic liner for 300 trips from
America to Europe and back. And if this
energy of one pound of dirt could be let loose
instantaneously, it would be equal in destructive
powers to over a million tons of dynamite.”</p>

<p>From the above statement, we may well understand
Dr. Le Bon’s interpretation of the
work of a dynamo: “Matter being easily dissociated
and constituting an immense reservoir
of intra-atomic energy, it is enough to admit
that the lines of force seized upon by the
conducting body (the coils), which cuts them
and causes them to flow in the form of an
electric current, are constantly replaced at the
expense of the intra-atomic energy. This latter
being relatively almost inexhaustible, a single
magnet can furnish an almost infinite number
of lines of force.”</p>

<p>It can be shown that the kinetic energy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
one kilogram (2.2 pounds) weight of matter
is about 9000 millions of millions of kilogram-meters,
or 25 thousand million kilowatt-hours
(a kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt hours). This
means, in other words, that the quantity of
energy in the atoms of 2.2 pounds of ordinary
matter is thousands of million times greater
than the energy of an equal quantity of coal,
<em>released by chemical combustion</em>.</p>

<p>Estimating the total energy consumed during
the year on earth for heat, light, power, etc.,
as about 15 millions of millions (= 15,000,000,000,000)
of kilowatt-hours, Steinmetz tells us
that 600 kilograms, or less than two-thirds of a
ton, of “dirt,” if it could be disintegrated into
energy, would supply all the heat, light and
energy demand of the whole earth for a year.</p>

<p>Several eminent physicists are now specializing
on the problem of how to liberate and
control intra-atomic energy for man’s uses—or
abuses. Bearing in mind the present intellectual,
moral and economic status of our
“leaders of thought” and their followers, and
remembering that one pound of common soil
contains intra-atomic energy equal in destructive
power to more than a million tons of dynamite,
let us hope that the secret of releasing
and “controlling” intra-atomic energy will not
be discovered in our day and age.</p>

<span class="fs70">PROOF THAT ELECTRONS ARE ATOMS OF ELECTRICITY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>THE ZEEMAN EFFECT</h3>

<p>Heinrich Hertz demonstrated in 1887 that he
could produce in the “ether”—or at least in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
space—what are now known as “wireless
waves,” by allowing a charge of electricity to
oscillate to and fro. Larmor and Lorentz were,
at the same time, endeavoring to formulate a
theory which would account for the production
of the far shorter light-waves.</p>

<p>Lorentz supposed that each atom contained
one or more infinitesimal particles, or electric
charges (electrons), whose excessively rapid
vibrations caused the emission of light-rays.
Maxwell showed that there must be a close connection
between light and electricity, a theory
converted into demonstrable fact by the work
of Hertz.</p>

<p>That there is a similar relation between
light and magnetism was the firm conviction
of Faraday. In 1845, he placed a block of very
dense glass between the poles of the most
powerful electromagnet produceable at the
time. Before turning on the switch, he allowed
a beam of light to pass through the glass, producing
“polarization”—a modification of light-rays
resulting from their reflection (in this
case from a crystalline substance), imparting
to the beam a definite direction—the plane of
vibration or plane of polarization. When the
switch was closed, permitting the flow of the
electric current, which produced the magnetic
field, the beam of light was “rotated.” That is,
the beam of light was “plane-polarized” by the
crystal, and “rotated” by the magnetic field;
i. e., now changed into two “circularly polarized”
rays, one a left-handed motion and the
other a right-handed motion (in the direction
of the hands of a watch).</p>

<p>This could be accounted for only on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
theory that light is affected by magnetism,
since the beam was not rotated by the glass
alone—in itself a very important discovery.
But the experiment did not yield Faraday an
answer to the question uppermost in his mind:
namely, can a magnetic field change the rate
of vibration of a light-emitting particle? That
is to say, in effect, can a magnetic field cause
a ray of light to shift its normal place in the
spectrum?</p>

<p>It was not until 1862, seventeen years after
the experiment just described, that Faraday attempted
to solve this important theoretical
problem. He now placed a sodium flame in
front of the slit of the spectroscope, which
normally yields two characteristic yellow lines
(the D lines of the spectrum), and observed
them with the best spectroscope at his command,
under the most powerful electromagnetic
field which he could produce. No change from
the normal could be detected. Other observers
tried the same experiment, but with negative
results. We know that his theory was well
founded, and that only the lack of a better
spectroscope and a more powerful magnet prevented
his discovery of what is now known as
the Zeeman effect—a discovery which has already
thrown a flood of light on a number of
difficult physical problems.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Working with much more powerful apparatus,
but following the same method of procedure
employed by the immortal Faraday, Dr.
Pieter Zeeman, of Leyden, succeeded, in 1896,
in experimentally demonstrating the close relationship
between light and magnetism. Dr.
H. A. Lorentz, then Professor of Physics in
the University of Leyden, now mathematical
physicist at the Norman Bridge Laboratory of
Physics, Pasadena, California, had predicted the
nature of the change in the spectral lines to
be expected, and this knowledge was used by
Dr. Zeeman as a check on his results.</p>

<p>Using a Rowland grating, instead of a less
efficient prism spectroscope, Dr. Zeeman found
that when a relatively weak electric current
was applied, the two sodium lines were merely
widened. In a still more powerful magnetic
field, each of the lines was decomposed into
two or three components, when the lines of
force were parallel to the line of sight.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Moreover,
the rays of the components of each line
“were not those of natural light,” but were
“polarized in a characteristic way,” i. e., were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
circularly polarized in opposite directions—“the
direction of the vibration depending in a simple
manner on the direction of the magnetic
lines of force.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The same effect has more recently been produced
in the case of the spectral rays of nearly—if
not quite—all the other elements. The
process, as described by Dr. George Ellery
Hale, is very simple: “We place our iron ore
or spark between the poles of a powerful magnet,
and photograph its spectrum. The lines
behave in the most diverse way, some splitting
into triplets, others into quadruplets, quintuplets,
sextuplets, etc. One chromium line is resolved
by the magnet into twenty-one components....
The distance between the
components of a line is directly proportional
to the strength of the magnetic field.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The meaning of this splitting and polarization
of light-rays in the magnetic field is that,
as Lorentz had predicted, there are present in
the luminous vapor vibrating particles negatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
charged, or “electrons.” Measurement
of the distances apart of the components of
the triple line reveals the relation between
the charge and the mass of the particles.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to add that the disturbances
in the magnetic field, as observed by Zeeman,
were precisely of the amount calculated by
Lorentz purely on theoretical grounds, and the
mass of the electron was found by this method
to be <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>1840</sub></span> that of the hydrogen atom. By a
different method, Sir J. J. Thomson obtained
a value of <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>1800</sub></span> the mass of the hydrogen
atom; while Dr. Robert A. Millikan, by means
of his famous “electrical balance,” derived a
value of <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>1845</sub></span> that of the hydrogen atom.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In his monograph of 1913, Zeeman remarked
that in discoveries of optics “we may always
cherish the hope that they will lead ultimately
to applications to astronomy.” So far as study
of solar phenomena and the Zeeman effect are
concerned, this hope has been fully realized,
and attempts are being made to extend the applications
of this method of investigation to
other stellar bodies. Of the general value of
Zeeman’s discovery, Dr. Hale writes: “The
complex phenomena of the Zeeman effect (as
revealed in a comparative study, with powerful
spectrographs, and an intense magnetic field, of
the lines of a long list of elements) furnish material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
available for wide generalization, important
in their bearing on theories of radiation
and atomic structure” (<em>Op. cit.</em>, Page <a href="#Page_36">36</a>).</p>

<p>Discovery by Hale and his co-workers at
Mount Wilson of the Zeeman effect in sun-spots
led to the very important conclusion that these
disturbances represent whirling vortices of
electrons, producing a magnetic field. “The
strength of the magnetic field produced, which
is measured by the degree of separation of the
triple lines, increases with the diameter of the
spot.... It has long been known that
sun-spots usually occur in pairs, and our study
of the Zeeman effect indicates that the two
principal spots in such a group are almost invariably
of opposite polarity” (Hale, Op. cit.,
Pages 28-31).</p>

<p>The sun, like the earth is now known to be
a magnet, whose general magnetic field is about
80 times as intense as that of the earth. At
the distance of the earth the solar magnetic
field is not appreciable, “since the effect of
one pole counteracts the equal and opposite effect
of the other pole.”</p>

<p>Were it not for our knowledge concerning the
Zeeman effect, it would not yet be known for
a certainty that the sun is a vast magnetic
globe, since this fact could not be assumed
to be a source of the sun’s gravitational power.
“Indeed,” says Dr. Hale,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> “its attraction cannot
be felt by the most delicate instruments at
the distance of the earth, and would still be
unknown were it not for the influence of magnetism
on light. Auroras, magnetic storms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and such electric currents as those that recently
deranged several Atlantic cables are due, not
to the magnetism of the sun or its spots, but
probably to streams of electrons, shot out from
highly disturbed areas of the solar surface surrounding
great sun-spots, traversing 93 million
miles of the ether of space, and penetrating
deep into the earth’s atmosphere.”</p>

<p>By means of the famous 150-foot tower telescope
at Mount Wilson, which produces at a
fixed point in a laboratory an image of the
sun about sixteen inches in diameter, the magnetic
phenomena of sun-spots are being studied
to great advantage, the enlarged sun-spots making
possible separate observation of their various
parts. “This analysis is accomplished with
a spectroscope 80 feet in length, mounted in a
subterranean chamber beneath the tower.” By
this means the very important discovery was
made by Director Hale that the entire sun, rotating
on its axis, is a great magnet. “Hence,”
says Dr. Hale, “we may reasonably infer that
every star, and probably every planet, is also
a magnet, as the earth has been known to be
since the days of Gilbert’s ‘<cite>De Magnete</cite>.’ Barnett
has succeeded in producing magnetism
by rapidly whirling masses of metal in the laboratory”
(Hale, “The New Heavens,” Pages 69-70).</p>

<p>More recently (October, 1922), Hale, Ellerman
and Nicholson, all of the Mount Wilson
Observatory, have detected <em>invisible</em> sun-spots
by searching for evidences of the Zeeman effect
in promising regions, such as areas of
flocculi following a large spot. “A special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
polarizing apparatus permits very small magnetic
fields to be found by the alternate widening
to red and violet of the iron triplet Lambda
6173,” say Hale and Adams (“Summary of
the Year’s Work at Mount Wilson,” Publications
of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,
October, 1922, Pages 269-70 [Vol. XXXIV, No.
201]). “The results confirm the view that a
spot represents a vortex, which becomes visible
only when the cooling due to the expansion (of
gases) is sufficiently great to produce a perceptible
decrease in the brightness of the photosphere.”</p>

<p>From what has been said, it is evident that
Dr. Zeeman’s desire to see the results of his
discovery applied to the study of astronomical
problems has been fully realized.</p>


<h3>THE STARK EFFECT</h3>

<p>Lorentz’s prediction regarding the effect of
a strong magnetic field on spectral rays, and
the movements of electrons in the field having
been confirmed so brilliantly by Zeeman, it
remained to ascertain what effect, if any, would
be exerted by electrical force on light-rays.</p>

<p>The answer to this problem was given by
Prof. Johannes Stark, at Aix-la-Chapelle, in
1913, by his skillful demonstration of the electrical
decomposition of the spectral rays of
hydrogen, helium and lithium.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Stark’s task was a more difficult one than
Zeeman’s, owing to the fact that he had to deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
with luminescent gases, which, being conductors,
exhaust the electrical field almost before
any observations can be made, even
hurriedly. This condition gives rise to difficulties
in connection with the application of
the electric field. But these were very ingeniously
met by employment of highly evacuated
tubes and the light emitted by the “canal
rays”—positively charged particles similar to
the alpha rays.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Where the rays issue from
the perforated electrode (or “canal”), the conduction
of electricity is weak, and Stark was
able to apply intense electric fields in a small
space. It was then found that the diffuse rays
of the spectrum produced were strongly influenced,
while the “sharp” rays were less so.</p>

<p>The attentive reader will note that this result
was in marked contrast with the <em>magnetic</em>
decomposition produced in the Zeeman experiment,
in which the rays did not differ one from
another in respect to the degree of their decomposition.
In all the details there is a difference
between the electric and magnetic decompositions,
and analogy existing only in this,
namely, that in both cases polarized rays were
obtained. In both cases the results produced
were due to disturbance of the <em>motions of electrons</em>,
giving rise to broadening, displacement
or other modifications of spectral laws. Both
“effects” confirm the theoretical view of Maxwell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
namely, that light is an electromagnetic
phenomenon.</p>

<p>Faraday’s famous question is thus more than
answered in the affirmative: not only is the
rate of vibration of “atoms” (electrons)
changed by a magnetic field, but also under the
action of an electrostatic field, producing <em>decomposition</em>
of certain spectral lines, which are
usually <em>polarized</em>, as in the Zeeman effect.</p>

<p>As a result of his intensive investigations of
the Zeeman effect, Dr. Henri A. Deslandres,
Director of the Astrophysical Observatory at
Meudon (a southern suburb of Paris), proposed
a new general formula which represents
the series relationship of the component lines
and heads of bands both for emission and absorption
spectra. According to his experimentally-derived
law, “the origin of these radiations
may be found in the transverse and longitudinal
vibrations of the atoms.”</p>

<p>The lamented Dr. P. S. Epstein, a gifted pupil
of Sommerfeld, who—like Mosely—fell a
martyr to the World War, succeeded in applying
the quantum dynamics to the Stark effect,
whereby the motions of the electron in producing
the H-beta (in the blue-green) and H-gamma
(in the violet) lines observed, “are accounted
for with great accuracy” (Loring,
“Atomic Theories,” Page 67).</p>

<p>It may be said in conclusion, that the most
promising attempts fully to explain the phenomena
of the Zeeman and Stark effects seem
to be made from the point of view of Planck’s
Quantum Theory of Light. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
it must be admitted that there has not been,
so far as I can ascertain, any theory proposed
which explains <em>all</em> of the phenomena involved.</p>

were caused by a strong magnetic field in
sun-spots, brought about by free electrons being

<span class="fs70">THE DISCOVERY OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The experimental foundation for the discovery
of wireless telegraphy was laid by the
researches of Faraday.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Accepting Faraday’s physical views as a point
of departure, James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879),
Professor of Experimental Physics in the University
of Cambridge, began (about 1860) the
development of his constructive speculations in
electrical theory which culminated in the now
universally accepted electromagnetic theory of
light.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Fourteen years after the publication of Maxwell’s
classic treatise, Heinrich Hertz (1859-1894)—a
brilliant pupil of Helmholtz (1821-1894)—succeeded
in producing electrical discharges
from a Leyden jar, which oscillations
in turn gave rise to electromagnetic waves of
far greater length than any previously
known.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Hertz demonstrated also that the velocity of
propagation of these waves was the same as
that of light-waves—approximately 186,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
miles a second, equivalent to about seven times
the circumference of the earth in one second.
It was shown that the only difference between
the Hertzian (“wireless”) waves, for example,
and the light-waves, is in their respective
length, or, reciprocally, their rates of vibration
per second. Hertz later demonstrated that
these invisible waves produced by a Leyden
jar could be reflected, refracted, and polarized,
as in the case with the far shorter light-waves
or rays.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> These results had been predicted
by Maxwell.</p>

<p>In this great discovery the foundation for
wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony was
laid—for Hertz had found what are now known
as “wireless” or radio waves—destined, perhaps,
to revolutionize our methods of obtaining
power for machinery, and for transportation, as
they have already revolutionized our methods
of communication. Hertz had done more than
this: for his investigations made possible a
far more satisfactory research into the structure
of atoms.</p>

<p>“If we were asked to pick out one date that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
stands out more prominently than others in
our acquisition of knowledge bearing upon the
structure of matter,” says Dr. Albert C. Crehore,
“it might be this epoch-making work of
Hertz.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>While it is true that the waves that Hertz
discovered and measured “differ from light-waves
merely in wave-length or period of vibration
and quality,” on the other hand the difference
in wave-length is so great that no instrument
had as yet been devised to measure or
detect waves that were meters long, as compared
with light-waves but a minute fraction
of a centimeter in length.</p>

<p>It was Hertz’s task—following up Maxwell’s
prediction—to devise an instrument which
would detect waves not cognizable by our
senses alone. For this purpose he used a
simple loop of wire with the ends brought near
together, each terminating in a metal ball.
When these balls were brought almost into contact,
a small electrical spark was seen to pass
between the balls when the “oscillator”—the
apparatus used to generate the oscillating currents,
or electric waves, of high frequency—was
set in operation.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Hertz not only proved that the speed of
electric waves is the same as that of light,
and that they are subject, under certain conditions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
to “interference” as are light-waves,
but he also succeeded in actually measuring
the length of the waves produced by his crude
apparatus. This was accomplished by producing
what are known as “standing waves,” analogous
to the sound-waves produced by an
organ-pipe. Moving his detector slowly along
the wire, Hertz observed that the spark would
appear when a certain interval of space was
reached, and as he continued to move the
detector the sparks would disappear and reappear
at regular distances. He rightly concluded
that these points of disappearance and
reappearance of the spark corresponded to the
nodes and loops of the “standing waves,”
representing the wave-length of the electrical
undulations.</p>

<p>It has since been established that the difference
in wave-length between the electric
undulations produced by Hertz and those of
light-waves may be enormous or quite moderate.
Professor Michelson tells us that “a telegraphic
wave”, which is practically an electromagnetic
disturbance, may be as long as 1000
miles. The waves produced by the oscillations
of a condenser, like a Lyden jar, may be as
short as 100 feet; the waves produced by a
Hertz oscillator may be as short as one-tenth
of an inch. Between this and the longest light-wave
there is not an enormous gap, for the latter
has a length of about <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub></span> inch. Thus
the difference between the Hertz vibrations
and the longest light-wave is less than the difference
between the longest and shortest light-waves,
for some of the shortest oscillations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
only a few millionths of an inch long. Doubtless
even this gap will soon be bridged over.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The Hertz apparatus was greatly improved
by Auguste Righi, in the University of Bologna.
In the same class in physics was Marconi, who
began his fruitful experiments in 1895, one
year after Sir Oliver Lodge had perfected the
coherer. Lodge’s coherer, used by Marconi in
his early work, consisted of a glass tube containing
a pinch of nickel and silver filings in
equal parts. Crude as this detector was,
judged by present-day standards, it materially
improved the conductivity of contact metals in
the case of Hertzian waves.</p>

<p>In 1899 wireless communication was established
across the English Channel, and in 1902
Marconi sent the first wireless message from
England to America. Today, wireless waves
measuring miles from crest to crest are being
employed in the transmission of messages from
points separated by thousands of miles, and
the human voice has already been carried
across the Atlantic by radiophone, but only in
one direction.</p>

<p>The wireless sending and receiving station
of the Dutch government, at Kootmyck, in the
Province of Gelderland, is equipped to employ
a 12,000-meter wave-length in sending and receiving
simultaneously messages between Holland
and Java, 7,500 miles distant. It has the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
same capacity as our Long Island (Rocky
Point) station, and is therefore one of the
biggest in the world.</p>

<p>On December 19, 1922, a long distance phonograph
which records sounds made hundreds of
miles away was demonstrated to the Society
of Western Engineers, by E. H. Colpitts, of the
Western Electric Company. The transmission
of electric power by radio is as yet but a
dream; but it is a dream which may come true
within the next five years.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Signals are now being received from stations
situated at distances as great as 12,000 miles,
made possible, it is believed by the existence
of an electrical conducting layer—electrified
dust expelled by the sun—some 150 miles in
depth, the bending of the radio-waves around
the earth being caused by diffraction. Some
unknown factor is operating to give the signals
a strength millions of times greater than can
be accounted for at present by any plausible
theory, according to Prof. J. A. Fleming (Fifth
Henry Truman Wood Lecture before the Royal
Society of Arts, London, 1922).</p>

<p>It is not reasonable to assume that no other
electromagnetic waves remain to be discovered.
We may yet hear “the roar of the sun-spots,”
though Edison’s experiments along this line
were unsuccessful. What, indeed, were the
mysterious “signals” occasionally reported as
having been received at Marconi wireless stations—registered,
it was reported in the press,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
“only when a minimum of sixty-five-mile wave-lengths
had been established,” but waves issuing
from the mighty sun, 93,000,000 miles distant?
However, Marconi tells us that one of
the “signals” comes as three short raps—“S”
in the Morse code. He believes that these
“signals” may have been sent out from Mars
or Venus. Similar mysterious “signals” were
reported by wireless stations in different parts
of the world during the apposition of Mars in
August, 1924.</p>

<p>“Outside of the radio-waves that are floating
about there may be hundreds of others which
we have not as yet been able to register....
There may be many other waves coming to us
from the sun, of which we have no knowledge
today.... The human ear cannot hear
below eight vibrations per second and not higher
than about 30,000 vibrations per second.
Certain animals can hear below and above that
scale. By means of our vacuum tubes certain
researches indicate that a tremendous amount
of noise goes on below the eight vibrations per
second, and still more noise above the 30,000
vibrations. Entirely new worlds lie in these
two directions, of which nothing is known
today. The vacuum tube is likely to solve
these mysteries and take us into the uncharted
worlds, far into the unknown, within the next
few years.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In March, 1922, the late Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz
said that he considered well founded the
supposition that performances of low-power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
radio sending apparatus in transmitting messages
to surprising distances gave an indication
that the radiations peculiar to wireless
transmission pass with equal ease through the
earth or through the “ether.”</p>

<p>Such radiations would be in accordance with
accepted electrical laws, as the ground, to
which both the sending antennae and the receiving
set are connected, would act as a return
circuit for the current. Similarly, water
might serve as a medium for radio conversations
between ships, or between ships and the
land.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was announced during the same
month that wireless telephony had been
revolutionized by the successful performances
of the duplex transmitters which the General
Electric Company had just completed. Conversations
were held between New York and
passengers aboard the steamer “America,”
which, at the time, was at a distance of 360
miles from shore.</p>

<p>The three-electrode audion or vacuum tube
was perfected in 1912, making radio-telephony
possible. In 1921, Reginald A. Heising, a young
physicist working for a degree of Master of
Science at the University of Wisconsin, conceived
the brilliant idea of putting into the
vacuum tube the amount of energy produced
by the voice, and then getting it out many
times amplified in the form of high-frequency
power in the antenna. This problem he soon
solved, so far as the principle of the modulation
system was concerned, and in 1922 the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
practical problem was worked out and the
method all but perfected.</p>

<p>All these great utilitarian advances have been
made possible by the researches of men interested
in the advancement of knowledge for its
own sake. As has been pointed out recently
by Dr. Hale (“The New Heavens,” Pages 87-88),
“Faraday, studying the laws of electricity,
discovered the principles which rendered the
dynamo possible. Maxwell, Henry and Hertz,
equally unconcerned with material advantage,
made wireless telegraphy possible.... Wireless
telephony and transcontinental telephony
without wires were both rendered possible by
studies of the nature of the electric discharge
in vacuum tubes.”</p>

<p>In an interview in December, 1922, Dr. Nikola
Tesla gave it as his opinion, based upon experiments
already carried out in his own laboratory
in New York City, that power flashed through
space by radio will soon be employed in all
the world’s activities.</p>

<p>“Besides bridging enormous distances in
flight and wireless conversation,” he said,
“modern science will span the earth with
power flashed through the air by radio. Airplanes
and ships and trains will carry no fuel,
but will run by transmitted energy. With
wireless power no one—explorers, travelers,
campers—need be cut off from civilization and
its comforts.”</p>

<p>“Not only that, but we shall see at great
distances by aid of wireless energy. And seeing
our neighbors across the oceans will make
for a united social and political world.”</p>

to separate any one particular vibration from the
rest.</p>
